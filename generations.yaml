generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1966
    end_year: 1967
    description: "The original Dodge Charger was introduced mid-1966 as a fastback variant of the Chrysler B-body platform, featuring distinctive styling with hidden headlights and a full-width grille with a 'wall-to-wall' taillamp design. The interior offered four bucket seats with a center console and race-inspired instrument gauges. Engine options ranged from the 318 cubic-inch V8 to the powerful 426 Hemi. Positioned as an upscale sports-type luxury model, sales of the 1966 and 1967 Chargers were modest due to the fastback design's proportions looking tall relative to its narrow track width."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 1968
    end_year: 1970
    description: "The second-generation Charger was completely redesigned for 1968 with iconic curved 'Coke bottle' body lines that became widely considered one of the most beautiful American cars of its era. Production demand exceeded expectations, with 96,100 units produced in 1968 alone. Engine options continued from small-block V8s to the legendary 426 Hemi and 440 Six Pack. The Charger gained significant cultural impact through television and film appearances, most notably as the 'General Lee' in 'The Dukes of Hazzard.' Special performance variants included the more aerodynamic Charger 500 and 1970 Charger Daytona designed for NASCAR racing. The 1970 Charger won the most NASCAR races that year, helping Bobby Isaac win the championship."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 1971
    end_year: 1974
    description: "The third-generation Charger was introduced for the 1971 model year based on Chrysler's modified B-platform to meet new emissions and safety regulations. Available in six different packages with cosmetic changes including a split grille, semi-fastback rear window, and ducktail spoiler. The 1973 and 1974 models featured minor differences in grille and headlamps, plus new quarter windows that were larger and shaped differently than the 1971-1972 models. Sales increased during this period primarily due to the elimination of the Dodge Coronet two-door, making the Charger Dodge's only two-door intermediate-size offering."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 1975
    end_year: 1978
    description: "The 1975 Charger was restyled to move the model into the growing personal luxury car market segment, sharing its body with the new Chrysler Cordoba. For 1976, former Coronet coupes were rebranded as Charger and Charger Sport variants. A Daytona model was added featuring distinctive stripes running along the length of the car. In 1978, Dodge added the Magnum to the personal luxury segment, completing the range."

  - name: "Fifth Generation"
    start_year: 1981
    end_year: 1987
    description: "After a three-year absence, the Charger returned in 1981 as a front-wheel-drive subcompact hatchback coupe with five-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission. Similar to the Dodge Omni 024 but slightly larger, it featured a 2.2L SOHC engine with optional turbocharged variant. A Shelby Charger variant was introduced starting in 1983, with the turbocharged version producing 142 hp in 1984, increased to 146 hp in 1985, and reaching 175 hp in 1987 with the Shelby-tuned GLHS model featuring an intercooler and upgraded fuel injection system. The final 1000 L-body Chargers built in 1987 were Shelby editions."

  - name: "Sixth Generation (LX)"
    start_year: 2006
    end_year: 2010
    description: "After a twenty-year absence, the Charger nameplate returned for the 2006 model year (introduced in 2005) as a full-size four-door sedan built on the Chrysler LX platform, incorporating some Mercedes-Benz E-Class components from the DaimlerChrysler era. The controversial four-door configuration was a significant departure from the classic coupe tradition but allowed the model to serve as both a performance vehicle and practical family car. Available in SE, SXT, R/T, and SRT8 versions with engine options from 2.7L V6 to 6.1L Hemi V8. All-wheel drive was first available only on the R/T package but expanded to SE and SXT versions from 2009 onward. The sixth generation reestablished the Charger as a modern American muscle car."

  - name: "Seventh Generation (LD)"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The seventh-generation Charger received comprehensive updates for 2011 with new exterior styling and interior quality while maintaining LX platform architecture. Updated side scoops, angular headlights, aggressive grille styling, and modern wrap-around LED tail lights improved driver visibility by over 15%. Base performance increased with a 3.6L Pentastar V6 replacing the previous 3.5L unit. The 2012 year featured a new eight-speed automatic transmission for the V6 model and the SRT-8 returned to the lineup. The Super Bee platform (later called Scat Pack 15+) was available starting in 2012, featuring a 6.4L engine rated at 470 hp."

    start_year: 2015
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The 2015 Charger received significant exterior styling updates with a new front end featuring new LED headlights, more aerodynamic nose design, and a noticeable curve around the headlight housing. Suspensions, interiors, and brakes were also redesigned. The 2017 model had an upgrade to the 8.4-inch navigation/display system. The lineup continued to include the SRT 392 and supercharged Hellcat variants. In 2020, the Charger Hellcat comes standard with the widebody package. For 2020, a new trim called the SRT Hellcat Redeye was added, producing 797 hp. In January 2022, Dodge announced that the Hemi V8 Charger would be retired at the end of the 2023 model year. Production concluded in December 2023 with Last Call special editions, marking the end of traditional HEMI-powered Chargers before the model's transition to electric power."
