generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1966
    end_year: 1967
    description: "The original Dodge Charger was introduced as a fastback variant of the B-body platform, featuring distinctive styling with hidden headlights and a full-width taillight panel. The interior offered four bucket seats and a full-length console, emphasizing its sporty character. Engine options ranged from the 318 cubic-inch V8 to the powerful 426 Hemi. This generation established the Charger as a style-focused performance car within the Dodge lineup, though sales were modest compared to later versions."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 1968
    end_year: 1970
    description: "The second-generation Charger featured completely redesigned bodywork with a curved 'Coke bottle' profile that became instantly iconic. This design is widely considered one of the most beautiful American cars of its era. Engine options continued to range from small-block V8s to the legendary 426 Hemi and 440 Six Pack. The Charger gained significant cultural impact through its appearance in films and television, most notably as the 'General Lee' in 'The Dukes of Hazzard' and the villain car in 'Bullitt.' Performance variants included the R/T and the rare Charger 500 and Charger Daytona with aerodynamic modifications for NASCAR racing."

  - name: "Third through Fifth Generations"
    start_year: 1971
    end_year: 1987
    description: "Subsequent Charger generations reflected the changing automotive landscape of the 1970s and 1980s. The third generation (1971-1974) maintained a muscle car image but with more rounded styling. The fourth generation (1975-1978) shifted to a personal luxury coupe based on the Chrysler Cordoba. The fifth generation (1982-1987) dramatically departed from tradition as a front-wheel drive hatchback based on the L-body platform, focusing on efficiency and practicality rather than performance. These transitions reflected the industry's response to changing consumer preferences, fuel economy concerns, and emissions regulations."

  - name: "Sixth Generation (LX)"
    start_year: 2006
    end_year: 2010
    description: "After a 19-year hiatus, the Charger nameplate returned as a full-size four-door sedan built on Chrysler's LX platform, which incorporated some Mercedes-Benz E-Class components from the DaimlerChrysler era. The controversial four-door configuration was a significant departure from the coupe tradition but allowed the model to serve as both a performance vehicle and practical family car. Engine options ranged from a 2.7L V6 to a 6.1L HEMI V8 in the SRT8 model. The sixth generation reestablished the Charger as a modern muscle car while expanding its appeal beyond the traditional performance market."

  - name: "Seventh Generation (LD)"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The seventh-generation Charger featured comprehensive updates to the exterior styling and interior quality while maintaining the LX platform architecture. Initially powered by the new 3.6L Pentastar V6 or 5.7L HEMI V8, the lineup expanded over time to include the 6.4L SRT 392 and later the supercharged 6.2L Hellcat variants producing up to 797 HP in the Redeye model. A significant facelift in 2015 introduced more modern styling with LED lighting and improved technology features. Throughout its production, the Charger maintained its position as America's only four-door muscle car, consistently receiving updates and special editions that kept the aging platform relevant. Production concluded in 2023 with various commemorative Last Call editions, marking the end of the traditional HEMI-powered Charger before its transformation into an electric vehicle for the next generation."
